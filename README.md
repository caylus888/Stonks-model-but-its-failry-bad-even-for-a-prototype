# Stonks-model-but-its-failry-bad-even-for-a-prototype
his project is my attempt at teaching a machine learning model to predict whether the stock market will go up or not. Sounds fancy, but let’s be real — right now the model is only getting about 54% accuracy. Which basically means it’s a very expensive coin toss. If you’re here for financial advice, I strongly suggest grabbing an actual coin instead

So why bother? For me, this is all about learning. I’ve been diving into pandas, data wrangling, and basic ML workflows, and this project has been the perfect playground. You don’t really realize how much work goes into cleaning data, trying different models, and tweaking parameters until you’ve spent a few late nights wrestling with them yourself. Even with such a simple problem, I’ve learned way more than I expected.

The code here is mostly Jupyter notebooks where I test different ideas, track results, and occasionally make questionable decisions that pandas doesn’t approve of. It’s messy in places, but that’s part of the process.

What I plan to do next:

Try to improve the model so it’s not just slightly better than random guessing

Build a UI and front-end to make it more user-friendly (for this, I’ll need to finally learn React — so expect some trial and error)

Keep updating the repo as I experiment and hopefully get something worth showing off

For now, it’s a half-baked stonks predictor, but I see it as step one in a much bigger journey of learning AI, ML, and eventually full-stack development. If you’re also learning, feel free to follow along, laugh at my mistakes, and maybe even share a tip or two.
